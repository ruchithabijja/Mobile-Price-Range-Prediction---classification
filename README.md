# Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction---classification

In the competitive mobile phone market companies want to understand sales data of mobile phones and factors which drive the prices. The objective is to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM, Internal Memory, etc) and its selling price. In this problem, we do not have to predict the actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is.


Data Preprocessing

1. Getting the dataset
2. Importing libraries
3. Importing datasets
4. Finding Missing Data
5. Encoding Categorical Data
6. Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

Exploratory data analysis(EDA)

1.Firstly Checked correlation between Each Features in dataset.

2.Checked if bluetooth and wifi available or not???

3.Checked can Battery Power be affected in mobile Price?? and how the battery mAh is spread

4.Checked can Ram, Screen Height  ,Screen width,pixel Height ,pixel width be affected in mobile Price??

5.Checked can 4G and 3G be affected in mobile Price??

6.Checked can FC (front camera megapixels) ,PC (Primary camera Megapixels) and Mobile Weight affected in mobile Price??

**Supervise Machine learning algorithms and implementation :**

1. Logistic regression

2. Random Forest Classifier

3. XG Boost Classifier
